This is a brief log of the changes applied to the master branch

Version 1.7.1 - Sep 19, 2013
============================

This is a minor release with small bugfixes and some feature enhancements:

- The README.txt file received some updates
  - Fixed typos in some commands given there
  - Added some observations gathered to help people to get it compiled
  - Make clear that Max OS 10.6 and lower might not work
    (if you manage to do this, let us know)

- Result of I2C test was printed in case of failure only. Now printout with any outcome and in the shape of an easy to understand 16x16 matrix.

- 'make clean' cleans the rpcgen directory as well

- protocol.h now supports std::string

- Command deser160 received an *experimental* feature to adjust for proper daleys when using a longer SCSI cable.
  Invoke deser160 will try to determine the correct delay values and sets them anew.
  Limitations: The function is reported to not always work. This is under investigation.
